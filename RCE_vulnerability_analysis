Challenge:Follina
to find cheksome of file:
   sha1sum filename

We recall that an attacker can get remote code execution whenever victims open up the document file. So that means malicious actors can insert their C2 channels/IP somewhere
inside the document(xml files).
In above clusters of urls we can spot a TargetMode=External preceded by Target and a url which leads to a HTML file. 
Again recall that the vulnerability exists in the html processing part of this process, means the actual payload must be hosted in a HTML FILE.

After execution, the sample will try to kill a process if it is already running. What is the name of this process?
Since the xmlformats site is no longer up and running we couldnt obtain the html file to analyse it directly.So we can again refer to our huntress blog
it states that whenever the exploit in script tags in html malicious file is executed one of the first things it do is kill msdt.exe
process so when our exploit process is complete we open the msdt process again with tampered switches.

Q8 Submit the MITRE technique ID used by the sample for Execution
WE know that our EXECUTION of malicious executable (2nd payload) is started via cli as arguments to cmd.exe
so if we go to
https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002/
we can see the technique id


Q9 Submit the CVE associated with the vulnerability that is being exploited
we can google follina and see the cve associated to it
    Answer: CVE-2022â€“30190;
